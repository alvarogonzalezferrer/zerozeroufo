HOW TO PLAY
=== == ====

You must kill all enemies to advance to next wave.

Currently waves are infinite, there is no ending coded yet.

Kidnap cows with tractor beam to restore UFO's armor.

You can shoot in all directions, combine your movement with shooting!

Touching the floor WILL damage your ship! Try to stay above ground!

Using the beam tractor will prevent your ship from flying up and down, use it wisely.
